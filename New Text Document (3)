input ports 
A routers input ports and switching fabric together implement the 
forwarding functions and are almost always implemented in hardware
   description:
Our study of the network layer so far has focussed on network layer service models,
 the routing algorithms that control the routes taken by packets through the network, 
and the protocols that embody these routing algorithms. These topics, however, 
 are only part  of what goes on in the network layer, switching function of a router 
 the actual transfer of datagrams from a router's incoming links to the appropriate outgoing
links.  Studying just the control and service aspects of the network layer is like studying 
 a company and considering only its management  and its public relations . To fully 
appreciate what really goes on within a company, one needs to consider the workers. 
 In the network layer, the real work  is the forwarding of datagrams.  A key component in 
this forwarding process is the transfer of a datagram from a router's incoming link to an
 outgoing link.  
•	Input ports.  The input port performs several functions.  It performs
 the physical layer functionality of  terminating an incoming physical link to a router. 
 It performs the data link layer functionality needed to interoperate with the data link
 layer functionality  on the other side of the incoming link. It also performs a lookup and 
forwarding function so that a datagram forwarded into the switching fabric of the router 
emerges at the appropriate output port.  Control packets  are forwarded from the input port to the routing
 processor. In practice, multiple ports are often gathered together on a single line card within a router.
