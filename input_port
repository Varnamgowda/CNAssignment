 An input port performs several key functions.
 It performs the physical layer function of terminating an incoming physical link at a router;
 this is shown in the leftmost box of the input port and the rightmost box of the output port in the figure above. 
An input port also performs link-layer functions needed to interoperate with the link layer at the other side of the incoming link; 
this is represented by the middle boxes in the input and output ports.
 Perhaps most crucially, the lookup function is also performed at the input port;
 this will occur in the rightmost box of the input port.
 It is here that the forwarding table is consulted to determine the router output port to which an arriving packet will be forwarded 
via the switching fabric.
 Control packets (for example, packets carrying routing protocol information) are forwarded from an input port to the routing processor.
 Note that the term port here – referring to the physical input and output router interfaces – is distinctly different from the 
software ports associated with network applications
